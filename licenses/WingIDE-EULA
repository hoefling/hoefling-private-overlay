GRANT OF NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE

otherwise defeats its built-in licensing verification and enforcement capabilities. The right to modification of the Software Product also does not include the right to remove or 
alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notice, legend, symbol or label in the Software Product.
You may at your discretion distribute patch files containing any modifications or improvements made to the Software Product. This right does not include the right to distribute
